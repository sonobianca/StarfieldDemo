# StarfieldDemo
This is a simple demo app to show how to use my StarfieldNode and InteractiveCameraNode.  I've included 
the source from *SKTUtils* and *nuts-n-bolts* in it so it's easier to load the project and experiment with it right away.

+ *SKTUtils* is freely available on Ray Wenderlich github's page
+ *nuts-n-bolts* is freely available on my github's page

All the necessary info is in the source code.
